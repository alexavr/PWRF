# PWRF
This is my modification of the PolarWRF by the [Polar Meteorology Group](https://polarmet.osu.edu/PWRF/) of the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center at The Ohio State University. 


I just took the latest (at the moment) version of PWRF (4.5.1) and integrated it with the proper version of WRF src. 

>[!NOTE]
> There was a bug in PWRF (./Registry/Registry.EM_COMMON.PWRF4.5.0) it's the only thing I fixed.  

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Compile WRF and WPS (follow the instruction on [WRF Users](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/))

Enjoy!
